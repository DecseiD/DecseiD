<h1 align="center">Hello there... General Keno... No that's another line. 👋</h1>

## 👨‍💻 Who am I?

I'm David but my friends call me David.

I consider myself as a passionate IT professional, currently working in the TELCO Cloud domain, blending roles across Linux system administration, DevOps engineering, and operations management.
Others might consider me as a crazy couch potato who sometimes talks to its Proxmox server while my dog is most likely considering me as his food source and servant...

Honestly... maybe all of them is true.

My past experiences include Service-Chain Operations management, Application Administration, Team Coordination, and Cloud Engineering... Or DevOps Engineering. No ones knows what does it include yet it includes everything.

This Github was created and updated for the sole purpose os spreading chaos through my personal experimentation, where I share my little projects, ideas, anguishes and ~~bugs~~ features.


### 🚀 Career Focus

- Kubernetes, OpenStack, CI/CD, BareMetal, Metal3
- TELCO Cloud engineering and support
- Networking and security best practices

I'm currently preparing for:
- 🏅 CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)
- 🛡️ **CompTIA Security+**

### 🧠 What I'm Working On

- Building experimental environments on a Proxmox home lab
- Automating infrastructure and operations for scalable cloud-native TELCO workloads
- Fulfilling my role in work as a Cloud Support Engineer and keeping up with everything there
- Conviencing others that it is definitely application problem...

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Linux (Currently SUSE is in the main focus), Containerization, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Ansible, Terraform, Proxmox, Grafana, and the rest. You know. EVERYTHING.

### 🌱 Fun Facts

- 🐶 I have a dog who often “helps” during late-night troubleshooting sessions.
- 🛠️ I enjoy breaking and fixing things in my homelab. But mostly breaking.
- 🎧 Music + Udemy training silenced and on 2x speed = 3 times longer learning time and many confusion about why my code is not working.
