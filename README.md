<h1 align="center">Hello there... General Keno... No that's another line. 👋</h1>

## 👨‍💻 Who am I?

I'm David but my friends call me David.

I consider myself as a passionate IT professional, currently working in the TELCO Cloud domain, blending roles across Linux system administration, DevOps engineering, and operations management.
Others might consider me as a crazy couch potato who sometimes talks to its Proxmox server while my dog is most likely considering me as his food source and servant...

Honestly... maybe all of them is true.

My past experiences include Service-Chain Operations management, Application Administration, Team Coordination, and Cloud Engineering... Or DevOps Engineering. No ones knows what does it include yet it includes everything.

This Github was created and updated for the sole purpose os spreading chaos through my personal experimentation, where I share my little projects, ideas, anguishes and ~~bugs~~ features.

### 🧠 What I'm Working On

- Building experimental environments on a Proxmox home lab

(Results: 3 times longer learning time and many confusion about why my code is not working)
